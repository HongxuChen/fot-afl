===============

  This doc lists some of the projects that are inspired by, derived from,
  designed for, or meant to integrate with FOT. See README for the general
  instruction manual.

-------------------------------------------
Support for other languages / environments:
-------------------------------------------

Python FOT (Jakub Wilk)
-----------------------

  Allows fuzz-testing of Python programs. Uses custom instrumentation and its
  own forkserver.

  http://jwilk.net/software/python-afl

Go-fuzz (Dmitry Vyukov)
-----------------------

  FOT-inspired guided fuzzing approach for Go targets:

  https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz

afl.rs (Keegan McAllister)
--------------------------

  Allows Rust features to be easily fuzzed with FOT (using the LLVM mode).

  https://github.com/kmcallister/afl.rs

OCaml support (KC Sivaramakrishnan)
-----------------------------------

  Adds FOT-compatible instrumentation to OCaml programs.

  https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-repo-dev/pull/23
  http://canopy.mirage.io/Posts/Fuzzing

FOT for GCJ Java and other GCC frontends (-)
--------------------------------------------

  GCC Java programs are actually supported out of the box - simply rename
  afl-gcc to afl-gcj. Unfortunately, by default, unhandled exceptions in GCJ do
  not result in abort() being called, so you will need to manually add a
  top-level exception handler that exits with SIGABRT or something equivalent.

  Other GCC-supported languages should be fairly easy to get working, but may
  face similar problems. See https://gcc.gnu.org/frontends.html for a list of
  options.

FOT-style in-process fuzzer for LLVM (Kostya Serebryany)
--------------------------------------------------------

  Provides an evolutionary instrumentation-guided fuzzing harness that allows
  some programs to be fuzzed without the fork / execve overhead. (Similar
  functionality is now available as the "persistent" feature described in
  ../llvm_mode/README.llvm.)

  http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html

FOT fixup shim (Ben Nagy)
-------------------------

  Allows FOT_POST_LIBRARY postprocessors to be written in arbitrary languages
  that don't have C / .so bindings. Includes examples in Go.

  https://github.com/bnagy/aflfix

TriforceFOT (Tim Newsham and Jesse Hertz)
-----------------------------------------

  Leverages QEMU full system emulation mode to allow FOT to target operating
  systems and other alien worlds:

  https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2016/june/project-triforce-run-afl-on-everything/

WinFOT (Ivan Fratric)
---------------------

  As the name implies, allows you to fuzz Windows binaries (using DynamoRio).

  https://github.com/ivanfratric/winafl

  Another Windows alternative may be:

  https://github.com/carlosgprado/BrundleFuzz/

----------------
Network fuzzing:
----------------

Preeny (Yan Shoshitaishvili)
----------------------------

  Provides a fairly simple way to convince dynamically linked network-centric
  programs to read from a file or not fork. Not FOT-specific, but described as
  useful by many users. Some assembly required.

  https://github.com/zardus/preeny

-------------------------------------------
Distributed fuzzing and related automation:
-------------------------------------------

roving (Richo Healey)
---------------------

  A client-server architecture for effortlessly orchestrating FOT runs across
  a fleet of machines. You don't want to use this on systems that face the
  Internet or live in other untrusted environments.

  https://github.com/richo/roving

Distfuzz-FOT (Martijn Bogaard)
------------------------------

  Simplifies the management of afl-fuzz instances on remote machines. The
  author notes that the current implementation isn't secure and should not
  be exposed on the Internet.

  https://github.com/MartijnB/disfuzz-afl

FOTDFF (quantumvm)
------------------

  A nice GUI for managing FOT jobs.

  https://github.com/quantumvm/FOTDFF

afl-launch (Ben Nagy)
---------------------

  Batch FOT launcher utility with a simple CLI.

  https://github.com/bnagy/afl-launch

FOT Utils (rc0r)
----------------

  Simplifies the triage of discovered crashes, start parallel instances, etc.

  https://github.com/rc0r/afl-utils

  Another crash triage tool:

  https://github.com/floyd-fuh/afl-crash-analyzer

afl-fuzzing-scripts (Tobias Ospelt)
-----------------------------------

  Simplifies starting up multiple parallel FOT jobs.

  https://github.com/floyd-fuh/afl-fuzzing-scripts/

afl-sid (Jacek Wielemborek)
---------------------------

  Allows users to more conveniently build and deploy FOT via Docker.

  https://github.com/d33tah/afl-sid

  Another Docker-related project:

  https://github.com/ozzyjohnson/docker-afl

afl-monitor (Paul S. Ziegler)
-----------------------------

  Provides more detailed and versatile statistics about your running FOT jobs.

  https://github.com/reflare/afl-monitor

-----------------------------------------------------------
Crash triage, coverage analysis, and other companion tools:
-----------------------------------------------------------

afl-crash-analyzer (Tobias Ospelt)
----------------------------------

  Makes it easier to navigate and annotate crashing test cases.

  https://github.com/floyd-fuh/afl-crash-analyzer/

Crashwalk (Ben Nagy)
--------------------

  FOT-aware tool to annotate and sort through crashing test cases.

  https://github.com/bnagy/crashwalk

afl-cov (Michael Rash)
----------------------

  Produces human-readable coverage data based on the output queue of afl-fuzz.

  https://github.com/mrash/afl-cov

afl-sancov (Bhargava Shastry)
-----------------------------

  Similar to afl-cov, but uses clang sanitizer instrumentation.

  https://github.com/bshastry/afl-sancov

RecidiVM (Jakub Wilk)
---------------------

  Makes it easy to estimate memory usage limits when fuzzing with ASAN or MSAN.

  http://jwilk.net/software/recidivm

aflize (Jacek Wielemborek)
--------------------------

  Automatically build FOT-enabled versions of Debian packages.

  https://github.com/d33tah/aflize

afl-ddmin-mod (Markus Teufelberger)
-----------------------------------

  A variant of afl-tmin that uses a more sophisticated (but slower)
  minimization algorithm.

  https://github.com/MarkusTeufelberger/afl-ddmin-mod

afl-kit (Kuang-che Wu)
----------------------

  Replacements for afl-cmin and afl-tmin with additional features, such
  as the ability to filter crashes based on stderr patterns.

  https://github.com/kcwu/afl-kit

-------------------------------
Narrow-purpose or experimental:
-------------------------------

Cygwin support (Ali Rizvi-Santiago)
-----------------------------------

  Pretty self-explanatory. As per the author, this "mostly" ports FOT to
  Windows. Field reports welcome!

  https://github.com/arizvisa/afl-cygwin

Pause and resume scripts (Ben Nagy)
-----------------------------------

  Simple automation to suspend and resume groups of fuzzing jobs.

  https://github.com/bnagy/afl-trivia

Static binary-only instrumentation (Aleksandar Nikolich)
--------------------------------------------------------

  Allows black-box binaries to be instrumented statically (i.e., by modifying
  the binary ahead of the time, rather than translating it on the run). Author
  reports better performance compared to QEMU, but occasional translation
  errors with stripped binaries.

  https://github.com/vrtadmin/moflow/tree/master/afl-dyninst

FOT PIN (Parker Thompson)
-------------------------

  Early-stage Intel PIN instrumentation support (from before we settled on
  faster-running QEMU).

  https://github.com/mothran/aflpin

FOT-style instrumentation in llvm (Kostya Serebryany)
-----------------------------------------------------

  Allows FOT-equivalent instrumentation to be injected at compiler level.
  This is currently not supported by FOT as-is, but may be useful in other
  projects.

  https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AsanCoverage#Coverage_counters

FOT JS (Han Choongwoo)
----------------------

  One-off optimizations to speed up the fuzzing of JavaScriptCore (now likely
  superseded by LLVM deferred forkserver init - see llvm_mode/README.llvm).

  https://github.com/tunz/afl-fuzz-js

FOT harness for fwknop (Michael Rash)
-------------------------------------

  An example of a fairly involved integration with FOT.

  https://github.com/mrash/fwknop/tree/master/test/afl

Building harnesses for DNS servers (Jonathan Foote, Ron Bowes)
--------------------------------------------------------------

  Two articles outlining the general principles and showing some example code.

  https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-to-fuzz-server-american-fuzzy-lop

  paths or crashes at any point in a fuzzing job.

  https://github.com/mboehme/pythia
